HEADPARTS                                   -   list of formid (in no specific order it would seem), prepended by the size of whole list (+33%)
#unknown# (1, 19, 0, 0, 0)                  -   5 bytes
NAM9 (Face morph values)                    -   76-byte struct (ends with 255,255,127,127)
#unknown#   (facepart probably)             -   int32 ?? Big endian?
NOSE FACEPART                               -   int32 ?? Big endian?
#unknown# (255,255,255,255)                 -   int32 ?? Big endian?

MOUTH FACEPART                              -   int32 ?? Big endian?
(flag24) Female                             -   Bool flag, only exists if female (and then == 1)


[1] so total length is the value of the first byte + 1 (to include itself)

HEADPARTS (no order): head mesh, mouth, scar, hair, hairline, eyecolor (both or each eyes), eyebrows, beard


##### NOTE ABOUT +33% #####
Some of the size-specifying
bytes before lists are 33%
too large. Eg. 56 instead
of 42 and 28 instead of 21.
Unsure why.

>>>> ITS A FUCKING VSVAL UGH <<<<
it's how many refids, times 4 b/c it's a 1 width vsval which means it's
bitshifted to the left by 2 which means multiplied by 4. sooooooo
